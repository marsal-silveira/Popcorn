## Development Stack

- xCode 9.2
- Swift 4
- CocoaPods as Dependency Manager
- Git Flow
- Architecture: VIPER + MVVM + Reactive (RxSwift)
- Moya + Alamofire + ObjectMapper
- No Storyboard (.xib and Programmatically)

## Third-Party libraries

- [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift) -> Used to get strong typed to resources like images, fonts and strings to avoid hardcoded strings.
- [Cartography](https://github.com/robb/Cartography) -> Allow to setup and use Auto Layout in declarative code (programmatically).
- [ParallaxHeader](https://github.com/romansorochak/ParallaxHeader) -> Add parallax header to UIScrollView or it's subclasses. Make app more elegant.
- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) -> Used to download and caching images from the web.
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) -> Enforce Swift style and conventions (loosely based on GitHub's Swift Style Guide).
- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) -> Allow to use Reactive Programming to simplify the way as we build apps using asynchronous operations and event/data streams.
- [RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxCocoa) -> RxSwift Cocoa extensions. With this we can use `.rx` in UI components.
- [Moya](https://github.com/ivanbruel/Moya-ObjectMapper) -> Network abstraction layer to simplify network commands and operations.
- [Moya-ObjectMapper/RxSwift](https://github.com/ivanbruel/Moya-ObjectMapper) -> ObjectMapper bindings for Moya for easier JSON serialization.
